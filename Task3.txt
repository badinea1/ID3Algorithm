Task 3 Question:
        What is the relationship between the learned decision tree and the version space 
        that is learned from these same examples? Is the learned tree equivalent to one 
        of the members of the version space?

Answer:
        The version space VS{H,D} is the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training data.
        The learned tree is the resultant structure which is able to classify new examples
        based on the features it has learned from said training data. 
        By doing this, the tree has narrowed its version space to include only new examples
        which are classified positively by the tree by reaching a leaf node with value "Yes".
        The learned tree is related to the version space in that it represents the hypothesis
        which is expressed with the inductive bias of the tree structure. 
        The tree is not equivalent to a member of the version space. The version space includes
        hypotheses consistent with the training data. The tree itself is not a hypotheses, 
        rather it is a structure which is able to determine the classification of an example
        with respect to the version space it represents.
